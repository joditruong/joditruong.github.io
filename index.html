  <title>jodi truong - psychology</title>
  
  <p class="lead mb-4">hi, my name is jodi truong and i'm a second-year psychology student at uc riverside. i am aiming to pursue my master's degree in psychology as well in the future. i'm into weightlifting, video games, computers, anime, manga, and psychology.  <br><br>
<br><br>
in the past, i have been employed at a swim school. this career granted me a lot of experience because i worked multiple positions that came with varying responsibilites. first, i worked as a swim instructor. i taught a large range of ages, spanning from babies that are less than a year old to seniors. secondly, i worked as a deck member. i had to walk back and forth across the pool and supervise the classes to make ensure no one got hurt. thirdly, i worked at the front desk. this position had me interact with numerous parents and students, as well as people who were interested in signing up for the swim school. i had to phone parents, reschedule classes, and greet people. on top of all this, i was required to be cpr trained. outside of this job, i also have gathered a lot of experiences through my hobbies. one of my hobbies is computers. i built my own pc using my learned expertise, and love assisting others in building their own. i'm also extremely into weightlifting. i like going to the gym everyday, so i know a lot about how muscle groups work and the optimal exercises to gain muscle. anime and manga are two of my favorite hobbies as well. however, i aim to pursue a bachelor's and then a master's in psychology in the future while maintaining my league of legends ranking. psychology has always been my favorite topic ever since i was in elementary school when i stumbled across a video of someone studying the subject. it piqued my interest even further when i watched a lot of netfix crime shows that involved diving into criminals' or murderers' thought processes in order to catch them. additionally, i found comfort in the subject because i've experienced a lot of mental health problems along with my family. studying the subject allowed me a deeper understanding for it as well as myself. i struggled to gain footing on a middle ground between my mental health and life in high school when applying for college. i wanted to help others as well as myself who have struggled with mental health problems in the past. therefore, i applied as a psychology major. through my major and higher education, i want to land a career that deals with mental health. i want to learn more about the roots of it, for myself and for other people. often, people with mental health problems feel as if something is wrong with them, as i have also felt this for a very long time. however, with my higher education, i want to reduce the stigma revolving mental health problems, especially in our modern day world where they have received more attention as we advance our knowledge in psychology.
